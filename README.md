gradle-lein
===========

Gradle plugin to transform leiningen build files to gradle tasks.

Currently, the plugin should work with gradle 1.8.

## What it should do
Eventually, the plugin should be able to bootstrap a whole gradle build with all leiningen tasks (including those added by plugins (e.g. ring).

## Current issues
* Lacks documentation
* Lacks tests
* Lacks license headers
* Does not support calling any leiningen tasks yet
